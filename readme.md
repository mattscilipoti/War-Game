## Project 1 - War

### User stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to see the cards flip so I feel like I'm playing a real card game.

2. As a user, I want to be able to reset the game so I don't have to refresh the page to play again.

3. As a fan of multiplayer games, I want to be able to play against a friend so I can feed my competitive streak.

4. As a loner, I want to be able to play against a computer, so I don't have to play as both players.

5. As a user, I want mutliple game modes so I don't get bored with only the basic game being available.
