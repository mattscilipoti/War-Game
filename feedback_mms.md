## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Good readme.  Your commits show good progression. In the future, I recommend more specific user stories.  These don't help to focus you towards a specific, early need.  Work on creating stories that lead from one need to another: compare cards, support tie (war).

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented, and more.  You have tackled some complex problems.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Good job. Html is clearly structured. Javascript is extracted into objects and functions, with good names.

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**.  You got the standard game woring and struggle some witht the "war" part.  That's what we expected.  :)
